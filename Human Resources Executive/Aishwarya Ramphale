As a startup, I feel all the sides of working with a good firm are available with Rtcamp. 
As mentioned by some of the reviews on glassdoor regrading remote employee, 
we can have a meet for all employees inorder to have better interaction. 
- For management changes, as there is open environment and everyone is heard,
speak whenever you want to or feel like so that leadership know where they lack.
